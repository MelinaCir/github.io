# Talking about comments

![PicOfMe](./images/me.png)

How did you implements comments to blog posts?

I decided to use Disqus to implement comments on my site. It took a while to set it up, as I could not get Disqus to show up on my site at all. After some error searching and help from on of the teacher assistants we eventually found what I was missing. I had misunderstood how to find the shortname that needed to be included in my config-file to be able to access Disqus. After finding this on my user site at Disqus the comment block finally showed up and have worked since then.
