# Talking about open graph
 

What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Open graph is actually what has taken me the longest and what I got stuck on. This is part of the reason I am handing this in so late. 

I eventually wrote some very simple code for open graph in its own file to the include in the head, both of which are in the _includes folder. I still could not get it to work on localhost, but will publish the site live in the hopes that this fixes the problem.

I wanted to have an open graph that showed the type and short description of the page as well as an image and of course link correctly.
